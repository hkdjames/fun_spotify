## Tips for Best Results

1. **Large Datasets**: The dashboard uses caching to handle large datasets efficiently
2. **Date Filtering**: Use date range filters to focus on specific periods
3. **Performance**: For better performance with very large datasets, consider filtering by year first
4. **Data Quality**: The dashboard filters out plays shorter than 30 seconds for better accuracy

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **File Not Found**: Ensure all JSON files are in the `raw_data/` directory
2. **Memory Issues**: If you have a very large dataset, try filtering by year or date range
3. **Slow Loading**: Large datasets may take a moment to load initially (cached after first load)

### Data Requirements
- JSON files must be named `Streaming_History_Audio_*.json`
- Files should contain valid JSON arrays
- Minimum data: timestamp, track name, artist name, and play duration

## Customization

The dashboard is highly customizable. You can:
- Modify color schemes in the Plotly configurations
- Add new visualization types
- Adjust filtering options
- Change the layout and styling

## Privacy

All data processing happens locally on your machine. No data is sent to external servers.
